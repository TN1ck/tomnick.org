excerpt: The enter/update/exit lifecycle created by d3.js revolutonized interactive visualisations on the web, but now we almost want to exclusively use React for building frontends. Reacts lifetime cycles are not suited for creating interactive visualisations that are animation heavy. By using React and mobx we build a custom and super fast lifetime mechanism that directly solves this problem.
