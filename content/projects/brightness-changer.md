I wrote BrightnessChanger to change the brightness of my external display. I often like to work with a reduced brightness, but sometimes I have to turn it up when it's reall bright outside. It was my first Swift/C project for macOs. Despite being a protoype, I still use it often und it works flawlessly. It's using the [DDC-Protocol](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Data_Channel) to change the attributes of the display. A lot of displays support this.
