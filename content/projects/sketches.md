[Sketches](http://tn1ck.github.io/sketches/app/) is a site where I wanted to share my sketches made with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), the JavaScript version of Processing. I actually wanted to make one sketch per week, but this didn't really work out. The coolest sketch is probably the tree generator, as the trees look really realistic.
