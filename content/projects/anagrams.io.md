With [anagrams.io](https://anagrams.io) we tried to create the best anagram generator in the world.
The project started because we once searched for anagrams and all generators were not sufficient enough.
The biggest challenge here was to combine the immense search space of an anagram generator with a nice and fast UI.
Using Mobx, webworkers and React this goal was achieved.
