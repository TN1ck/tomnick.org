I wrote my bachelor thesis for the DAI Laboratory. It's used there as a social search engine. One can query their search engine and rate/save the results. The actions were gamified, so the users were more motivated to actually rate the results. Using websockets the actions immiately affected the global leaderboard and score, so the application could be used to shown on an office screen.
The layout engine of the application was written by me, as well as all other things. The technologies used were exclusively lower level things like react, reflux, lodash.
