[Pokémoncries](https://pokemoncries.com) is a small little game, where you have to recognize a Pokémon with its GameBoy sound. I originally created it as a gift, but then we polished it a bit and released it.
It was initially released on [reddit.com/r/pokemon](https://reddit.com/r/pokemon) and on the german games site [GamePro](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/pokemon-cries-testet-euer-wissen-erkennt-ihr-die-game-boy-sounds-aller-pokemon,3327842.html).
The Youtuber aDrive then created a video called ["Pokemon Cry Challenge"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2Oy495gBGQ) where he played the game, afterwards a lot of other Youtubers followed suit and also did the Pokémon Cry Challenge.
It's really nice to see how much people seem to enjoy this small little game and how it went viral in a small circle of Pokémon players.
